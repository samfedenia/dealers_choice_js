Great job, Sam! 5 outta 5 ðŸ¤© Your code is clean, easy to read, and simple.
I like the use of a base query SQL statement that you add other queries to.
There are a few empty html tags in your code. I really appreciate the detailed set up instructions in the README. 

One quick thing to note: whenever you're pushing code to github you should **always** have a `.gitignore` file so that you can exclude certain files from being tracked and uploaded to github. This is something that will become more important in the future.
